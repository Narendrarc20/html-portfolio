<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>hi i am Narendra fron karnataka india, and i'm a Student.You may love your cat, but you may not be fully aware
   of just how cool your she — and her overall species — really is. For example, did you know that cats have an extra
  organ that allows them to taste scents? Or that they developed meowing as a way to communicate exclusively with
  humans?</p>

<p>The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth,
  and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. Its night vision and sense of smell are well
  developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting
  as well as cat-specific body language. Although the cat is a social species, it is a solitary hunter. As a predator, 
  it is crepuscular, i.e. most active at dawn and dusk. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human 
  ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals.[7] It also secretes and perceives pheromones.</p>

<p>As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.[14][15] As of 2017, 
  the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned[16][17][18] and 
  around 42 million households owning at least one cat.[19] In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an 
  estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020</p>
